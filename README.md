<h3>Rook</h3>

<p> A rook is a type of piece which moves horizontal or vertically 7 steps in any direction possible for 
8 x 8 chess board.

i.e. If we put rook in the center of origin(0,0), it can make steps until (0,7), (7,0), (-7,0) (0,-7)
</p>

For calculating all possible moves for Rooks, we need to map the rook_moves with the current location coordinates.
